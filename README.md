# SimplePseudoBytecodeInterpreter
Simple Pseudo-bytecode interpreter made in C.
I make this project, because i need some knowlage about pseudo-bytecode interpreter, so this propably will work, but i can't promise anything
As all my repos - it's not meant to work - I make this project, because it's fun.
