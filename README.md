# SimplePseudoBytecodeInterpreter

Simple Pseudo-bytecode interpreter made in C.

_Don't use "real_interpret_bytecode_interpret.c" - this is not ready yet - it will be working in 3 days or so_

I make this project, because i need some knowlage about pseudo-bytecode interpreter, so this propably will work, but i can't promise anything

As all my repos - it's not meant to work - I make this project, because it's fun.
